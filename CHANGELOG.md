# Changelog

## v4.0.0-rc1

- Native Runtime Tests 1–5 passed.
- Validated native custom Luna routing through project custom agents.
- Validated automatic delegation through the `AGENTS.md` policy and Daily Profile selected role.
- Validated native leaf enforcement with `[agents] enabled = false`.
- Validated native parallel delegation with Sol-authored acceptance.
- Removed mandatory Hook architecture from the current runtime design.
- Formalized the stable five-role Luna layout for `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`.
- Added explicit-target installer lifecycle validation for clean install, safe merges, idempotency, upgrade, manifest-owned legacy migration, backup, exact rollback, and uninstall.
- Kept real global installation approval separate. Sandbox validation does not authorize writes to a user's Codex home, and clean global validation remains required before stable `v4.0.0`.

## v4.0.0-prototype (historical)

- Added native project-scoped custom Luna agents with stable role names.
- Added the project-level `AGENTS.md` delegation and Sol acceptance policy.
- Retained the Daily ModelDial selector as a clean fixtures-first standard-library module.
- Added explicit first-party live-source validation, LKG, fail-closed behavior, and repo-local state.
- Added a separate native leaf experiment without changing the five formal agents.
- Added a dry-run installer plan, local capability probe, cross-platform CI, tests, and public-repository documentation.

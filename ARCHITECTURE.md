# v4.1.0-rc2 Native Architecture Note

Status: `v4.1.0-rc2 — POLICY/DOCS SOURCE CANDIDATE / REPOSITORY-CONTEXT VALIDATION PENDING`

`v4.0.0` remains the stable release. The published `v4.1.0-rc1` prerelease retains its recorded real global upgrade and fresh-session Global Runtime G1-G7 PASS. RC2 aligns repository policy and documentation while leaving the RC1 installed selector and runtime payload unchanged.

## Flow

```text
GPT-5.6 Sol
  -> Global / Project AGENTS delegation policy
  -> Daily Selector
  -> Native custom Luna agent (native agent_type)
  -> GPT-5.6 Luna / selected effort
  -> Native leaf ([agents] enabled = false)
  -> Sol Acceptance Gate
```

## ModelDial source flow

```text
Valid same-day Daily Profile -> reuse immediately
Otherwise:
  Official ModelDial API v1
    -> invalid or unavailable: Official Full Snapshot JSON
    -> invalid or unavailable: valid LKG
    -> invalid or unavailable: NO_LUNA_PROFILE_AVAILABLE
```

The API adapter accepts only schema `1.0` from the published [OpenAPI 3.1 contract](https://modeldial.com/openapi-v1.json), first-party provenance, a coherent batch, and exactly one row for each canonical Luna effort through the `codex` / `gpt-5.6-luna` / `official_login` route. A valid API response stops acquisition. Sources are never merged or arbitrated. Radar HTML runtime fallback is removed in v4.1.

## Stable boundary

- Sol is the sole planner, architect, orchestrator, ambiguity resolver, and final reviewer.
- The inherited Global `AGENTS.md` policy invokes the installed selector for the current Beijing-day role before non-trivial delegation. Repository policy does not maintain a second Daily role authority.
- The five stable roles map `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` to native custom agents running GPT-5.6 Luna at the selected effort. `ultra` is excluded.
- Native `agent_type`/custom-agent selection is the only model and effort boundary. There is no direct model override.
- Every formal Luna custom agent has `[agents] enabled = false`; Luna is a native leaf and cannot spawn or delegate.
- At most three native Luna children may run concurrently.
- The selector owns daily role choice. It does not spawn agents or perform acceptance.
- Project development state lives under ignored `.var/` and is non-authoritative for actual Codex project delegation. Global state is explicitly rooted at `<CODEX_HOME>/sol-luna-v4/state` and contains only the daily profile, v4 LKG, and selector lock.
- Global policy is rendered from `templates/AGENTS.global.md` with safely quoted selector and state paths; it does not install the repository policy verbatim.

## Explicit non-goals

- No Hook Router, Hook Trust layer, managed-child registry, daemon, background scheduler, database, dashboard, IPC server, plugin framework, or custom orchestration engine.
- No unapproved global Codex mutation. Installer writes require an explicit target, and repository-local validation is restricted to `.tmp/installer-validation/`; routine lifecycle tests use fake homes only.
- CI and static checks are supporting evidence; Native Runtime Tests 1-5 are the runtime gate.

## Global migration transaction

- Only an exact legacy manifest version `3.2` is supported; unknown or malformed manifests fail closed.
- Migration backs up every changed, removed, newly created, and commit-marker path. It does not convert legacy state or access the live selector source.
- Five agents, selector, shared config/policy, exact legacy-owned groups, and exact legacy-owned files are applied and validated before commit.
- `<CODEX_HOME>/sol-luna-v4/install-manifest.json` is atomically written last as the v4 commit marker.
- The old manifest is cleaned up after commit. A cleanup-only failure records `LEGACY_MANIFEST_CLEANUP_PENDING` and is retried without rolling back valid v4 content.
- Unowned `sol-luna-router/audit-bundles/` content is `PRESERVE_REVIEW_REQUIRED` and is never part of installer cleanup.

## Runtime status

Native Runtime Tests 1-5 are recorded as generic `PASS` for the stable v4.0.0 release:

1. Project custom-agent discovery passed in a fresh project session.
2. Explicit native spawn passed with the named custom agent's GPT-5.6 Luna model and configured effort.
3. `AGENTS.md` policy delegation passed: Sol used the current Daily Profile selected role and performed acceptance.
4. Native leaf enforcement passed: `[agents] enabled = false` removed child multi-agent/delegation tools.
5. Parallel native delegation passed: two independent bounded checks used the selected role and Sol consolidated the result.

The generic record intentionally contains no session IDs, usernames, absolute paths, rollout IDs, or installation IDs.

The published v4.1.0-rc1 prerelease passed its recorded real global upgrade and fresh-session Global Runtime G1-G7 for discovery, selector plus explicit Luna, automatic delegation, native leaf, native parallel execution, Sol acceptance, and legacy absence in one Codex Desktop/App Server environment. RC2 does not change the installed runtime payload; a fresh repository-context delegation check remains pending for the project-policy alignment.

## Stable boundary

`v4.0.0` is validated against the tested Codex Desktop/App Server environment and makes no compatibility promise for future Codex versions. Legacy audit bundles, migration backups, and trusted Hook metadata are non-runtime residual evidence, not current architecture dependencies.
